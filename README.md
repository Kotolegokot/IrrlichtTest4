# IrrlichtTest4
Fuck you bitch motherfucker

## Building
### Linux
You must have Irrlicht headers and library (the package is usually called `irrlicht-devel`).

### Windows
You must compile (or get somewhere else) `Irrlicht.dll` and put it into `lib\` in the project root directory. Irrlicht headers are already contained in `include\`.
